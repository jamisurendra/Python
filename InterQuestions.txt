Q) What is difference between partitioning and bucketing in Spark?
A) The resulting partitioned dataset is then saved as a parquet file in the specified directory. 
Bucketing is a way to assign rows of a dataset to specific buckets and collocate them on disk. 
This enables efficient wide transformations in Spark, as the data is already collocated in the executors correctly

Q) What is the difference between the pivot_table and the groupby
A) The groupby method is generally enough for two-dimensional operations, but pivot_table is used for multidimensional grouping operations.

Q) What is the difference between the loc and the iloc
A) Loc and iloc are two functions in Pandas that are used to slice a data set in a Pandas DataFrame. 
  The function . loc is typically used for label indexing and can access multiple columns,
  while . iloc is used for integer indexing.

Q) Python map() function
A) Syntax: map(fun, iter)
Parameters:
map() can be used to iterate through objects in an array and, in a similar fashion to traditional arrays,
modify the content of each individual object and return a new array.

Q) What is immutable ? 
A) an object is considered immutable if its value cannot be changed after it has been created. 
This means that any operation that modifies an immutable object returns a new object with the modified value.
Lists, dictionaries, and sets are instances of mutable objects, 
while numbers, strings, and tuples are instances of immutable objects
