➡ Managed Tables:

⭕ A managed table is like a bookshelf that belongs to the library. The library staff is responsible for arranging the books on the shelves, organizing them by genre or author,
and ensuring they are in good condition.
The books are kept within the library's premises, and readers can easily find them by browsing the shelves.
⭕ Similarly, in a managed table, the database system takes care of storing the data in its own storage system, organizing it in a structured format,
and managing its lifecycle. The data is kept within the database's control, and users can access it through queries and analysis.

➡ External Tables:

⭕ An external table is like a book borrowed from another library or owned by a reader. 
The book is not stored on the library's shelves but is instead kept outside in the reader's home or another library. 
The library keeps a record of the book's details, such as its title, author, and borrower, but the book itself is not physically present in the library.
⭕ Similarly, in an external table, the database system maintains only the metadata or information about the data, such as its structure and location,
but the actual data resides outside the database's control, in an external storage location. Users can still access and query the data,
but it remains separate from the database system's storage.
